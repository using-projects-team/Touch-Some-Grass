# Touch Some Grass

Have you ever been at a conference and wished you could spend some time outside instead of behind a screen all day? Well look no further! Touch Some Grass is a new application that allows users to search locations and get activities nearby for good weather!

## In Depth

By using a map and a weather API, the application is able to determine either where the user currently is, or shows them a location of their choosing. Once a location is selected, the app determines if the weather is good or bad, and if it is good, will return places within 5 miles in order for the user to fully enjoy the good weather. 



## Usage

```python
Finding and displaying the weather of a location over a span of time

Google Map display of places nearby

Current Location

Getting out from behind that monitor!
```
